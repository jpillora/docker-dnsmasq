[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/jpillora/dnsmasq.svg)][dockerhub]

### Usage

1. Create a [`/opt/dnsmasq.conf`](http://oss.segetech.com/intra/srv/dnsmasq.conf) file on the Docker host

   ```ini
   #dnsmasq config, for a complete example, see:
   #  http://oss.segetech.com/intra/srv/dnsmasq.conf
   #log all dns queries
   log-queries
   #dont use hosts nameservers
   no-resolv
   #use cloudflare as default nameservers, prefer 1^4
   server=1.0.0.1
   server=1.1.1.1
   strict-order
   #serve all .company queries using a specific nameserver
   server=/company/10.0.0.1
   #explicitly define host-ip mappings
   address=/myhost.company/10.0.0.2
   ```

1. Run the container

   ```
   $ docker run \
   	--name dnsmasq \
   	-d \
   	-p 53:53/udp \
   	-p 5380:8080 \
   	-v /opt/dnsmasq.conf:/etc/dnsmasq.conf \
   	--log-opt "max-size=100m" \
   	-e "HTTP_USER=foo" \
   	-e "HTTP_PASS=bar" \
   	--restart always \
   	jpillora/dnsmasq
   ```

1. Visit `http://<docker-host>:5380`, authenticate with `foo/bar` and you should see

1. Test it out with

   ```
   $ host myhost.company <docker-host>
   Using domain server:
   Name: <docker-host>
   Address: <docker-host>#53
   Aliases:

   myhost.company has address 10.0.0.2
   ```

1. Apply new DNS records

   You can reload the dnsmasq service without restarting the container with the following command:

   ```
   docker exec dnsmasq pkill -HUP dnsmasq
   ```
